//After each one types out, it should stay long enough to read (maybe 2 seconds?), and then the next one should start typing out.

	"Hello, engineer! I'm India, and this is the destination selection screen!"
	"From here you can choose where to send the rover you're going to build."
	"Each place has a different mission for your rover to complete!"

{//SELECTED PLANET IS THE MOON
"Because of the dust on the moon, treads aren't a good choice for locomotion."
"Hovercrafts need flat surfaces to work well, and the Moon doesn't have many of those."
"The weather station tool allows your rover to take the temperature."
"Your rover needs the high gain antenna in order to get the instructions you send."
"Humans were last on the Moon in 1972. The last rover to go to the Moon landed in 2013!"]
"The moon spins as it rotates around the Earth, so we can't see the dark side!"
{//DISPLAYED INFO
"The Moon orbits around the Earth."
"Surface: Rocky and Dusty"
"Rover's Mission: Take a temperature reading on the side of the Moon that faces away from Earth."}
}

{//SELECTED PLANET IS MARS
"Wheels or treads will work well for your rover on Mars."
"Your rover needs the high gain antenna in order to get the instructions you send."
"Whatever other analysis tools you choose, you will still need the rock grinder to get started."
"The ChemCam might help you complete this mission."
"The spectrometer and the rock grinder are a good tool pair for this mission." 
"Your rover will need some sort of scope to detect tiny fossils." 
"There have been four successful robotically operated Mars rovers. Let's make it five!"
{//DISPLAYED INFO
"Mars is the forth planet from the Sun"
"Surface: Rocky and Dusty"
"Rover's Mission: Study the rocks to look for evidence of liquid water and for tiny fossils of ancient life."

}

{//SELECTED PLANET IS TITAN
"There is liquid and ice on Titan's surface, so don't try putting wheels on your rover!"
"Your rover needs the high gain antenna in order to get the instructions you send."
"Your rover will need some sort of laser to drill through the ice on the surface."
"To study the soil, you'll need something that magnifies microscopic particles."
"From Titan, Earth looks like a tiny blue dot."
"A spacecraft landed on Titan in 2005 and sent back pictures!"
{//DISPLAYED INFO
"Titan is a moon that orbits Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun. "
"Surface: Icy"
"Rover's Mission: Study the soil and ice layer to look for evidence of life."}
}

{//SELECTED PLANET IS PLUTO
"The landscape on Pluto will be tricky to navigate. Wheels wouldn't work at all!"
"Your rover needs the high gain antenna in order to get the instructions you send."
"Only one analysis tool can take pictures, but how many other tools can you fit?"
"No human spacecraft has ever been on Pluto ... yet!"
"Pluto is smaller than the Moon, but we know much less about it!"
{//DISPLAYED INFO
"Pluto is a dwarf planet that orbits very far away from the Sun."
"Surface: Rocky and Ice"
"Rover's Mission: Take a picture of Pluto's surface."}
