#define RV_CONTENT_VICTORY_SCREEN_PLUTO_OBJECTIVE_1 (@"The first picture from the surface of Pluto! What a view! Look at that huge crater in the distance!\nSome scientists think that Pluto’s moon Charon might have formed when something ran into Pluto, and that it might have formed a huge underground ocean! That crater is too small to be from Charon, though. What other secrets are here?\nYour next objective is 31 meters to the North-West!")
#define RV_CONTENT_VICTORY_SCREEN_PLUTO_OBJECTIVE_2 (@"Great shot!\nLike many scientists predicted, the surface is made mostly of Nitrogen ice. On earth, Nitrogen is mostly a gas and a large part of what we breathe! And your rover is driving on it!\nLet’s keep exploring! Your next objective is 8 meters to the South-West, but the way is blocked, so you’ll have to head North-East to loop around it!")
#define RV_CONTENT_VICTORY_SCREEN_PLUTO_OBJECTIVE_3 (@"Whoa! Look at all those craters and fault lines!\nThose might be from when Pluto’s moon Charon was formed, billions of years ago! The gravity between them might have formed a huge underground ocean on Pluto, and it might still be there! There’s still a lot to be learned on Pluto in future missions.\nYou can start a new mission, or you can keep exploring!")

#define RV_CONTENT_VICTORY_SCREEN_MOON_OBJECTIVE_1 (@"The thermometer reads -300 F! Wow, that’s cold!\nDid you know that the Dark Side of the Moon isn’t actually always dark? We just call it that because it’s always facing away from us!\nYour next objective is 50 meters to the South-East! Stay near the northern cliff face to get there!")
#define RV_CONTENT_VICTORY_SCREEN_MOON_OBJECTIVE_2 (@"The thermometer reads -390 F! That’s even colder than the first reading!\nNight time on the moon is called a lunar night, and it lasts for about a month! That’s when it’s very cold on the moon, but it’s very hot when the sun is shining!\nYour final objective is 14 meters to the South, but you’ll have to loop back around to the North to get there!")
#define RV_CONTENT_VICTORY_SCREEN_MOON_OBJECTIVE_3 (@"The thermometer reads -420 F! That’s a few degrees colder than the coldest temperature recorded in the solar system!\nIn this crater, the sun has never shined! It’s called a permanently shadowed region, because it’s never seen the sun! No wonder it’s so cold!\nYou can start a new mission, or you can keep exploring!")

#define RV_CONTENT_VICTORY_SCREEN_TITAN_OBJECTIVE_1 (@"The rover found liquid ethane and methane here!\nThose are dangerous chemicals on Earth, but they’re all over the place on Titan. It might be possible for life to grow in them, but your rover didn’t find any here.\n\ Your next objective is 30 meters to the South-West, but it’s a little tricky to get there! Head South, then West, then right at the fork!")
#define RV_CONTENT_VICTORY_SCREEN_TITAN_OBJECTIVE_2 (@"There’s a lot of methane and ethane ice under the surface at this site, but it doesn’t look like there’s any life in that ice.\nTitan is the only moon in the solar system that has a full atmosphere, which makes it warmer than most moons. It’s still very cold, though, but maybe there’s liquid water deep under the surface. We know life can form in liquid water because that’s what happened on Earth!\nYour final objective is 19 meters to the South-East!")
#define RV_CONTENT_VICTORY_SCREEN_TITAN_OBJECTIVE_3 (@"Your rover found traces of water ice under the surface here!\nAnd where there’s ice, maybe there’s water farther underground where it’s warmer.\nAnd where there’s water and heat, there might be life!\nYou can start a new mission, or you can keep exploring!")

#define RV_CONTENT_VICTORY_SCREEN_MARS_OBJECTIVE_1 (@"You found some water ice in that sample! That’s not too strange, though. There’s actually a lot of water on Mars, but it’s almost all frozen or water vapor. \nKeep searching for any signs of liquid water!\nYour next objective is 10 meters to the North, but head South-West first to get there!")
#define RV_CONTENT_VICTORY_SCREEN_MARS_OBJECTIVE_2 (@"No evidence of liquid water here.\nMars can’t support liquid water now, but maybe it hasn’t always been that way. Millions of years ago, it might have had lakes and oceans on it! Keep searching!\nYour next objective is 30 meters to the East, but you’ll have to head South first to get around a rocky outcropping.")
#define RV_CONTENT_VICTORY_SCREEN_MARS_OBJECTIVE_3 (@"Wow! That rock sample contained some materials that might mean it formed in the presence of liquid water!\nYou didn’t find any tiny fossils, but if there was liquid water on Mars long ago, there might have been life there as well!\nYou can start a new mission, or you can keep exploring!")
